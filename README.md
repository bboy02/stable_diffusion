Stable Diffusion from Scratch
This repository demonstrates how to build a Stable Diffusion model from scratch, inspired by the paper "High-Resolution Image Synthesis with Latent Diffusion Models" by Rombach et al. (2022). Stable Diffusion is a state-of-the-art generative model that enables high-quality image synthesis. This project provides an in-depth understanding of the key components and steps involved in implementing and training a stable diffusion model.

Overview
Stable Diffusion models are based on diffusion probabilistic models, which learn to generate data by reversing a gradual noise-injection process. These models have gained significant popularity due to their ability to generate realistic images from textual descriptions.

The original paper introduced Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs), which perform the diffusion process in a compressed latent space (instead of pixel space), significantly improving computational efficiency and image generation speed while maintaining high quality.

Key Components
Attention Mechanism
Enhances the modelâ€™s focus on critical features in the image generation process.

CLIP Model
A vision-language model used to align textual descriptions with image features, ensuring that the generated images match the given prompts.

DDPM (Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models)
The core of the stable diffusion process, which learns to reverse a Markovian noise process to generate images from noise.

Encoder & Decoder
Compresses images into a latent space before applying the diffusion process and decodes the latent representation back into images after diffusion.

Diffusion Process
Implements both the forward and reverse noise-injection steps, refining the image over multiple iterations to improve quality.

U-Net Architecture
A convolutional neural network used in the diffusion model for denoising, ensuring high-quality image generation throughout the diffusion process.

Latent Space Processing
Rather than operating in pixel space, LDMs work in a lower-dimensional latent space, reducing computational cost while maintaining high generation quality.

Implementation Steps
1. Data Preparation
Preprocess image and text data to ensure they are well-structured and ready for training. This may involve resizing, normalization, and text-tokenization.

2. Feature Extraction
Utilize a pretrained CLIP model to extract semantic features from text and images. These features are crucial for aligning the generated images with textual descriptions.

3. Model Training
Train the diffusion model on a large dataset. Techniques such as curriculum learning can be used to stabilize training and progressively introduce complexity to the model.

4. Optimization
Enhance model performance using techniques like learning rate scheduling, weight decay, and gradient clipping. These optimizations help with model convergence and avoid overfitting.

5. Inference Pipeline
Convert textual prompts into latent representations using the CLIP model, apply the trained diffusion model to refine the representation, and decode the final image from the latent space.

6. Post-Processing
After image generation, apply techniques such as upsampling and fine-tuning to further enhance the image quality and reduce any artifacts that may have been introduced during the diffusion process.

Conclusion
Building a Stable Diffusion model from scratch involves understanding key components such as diffusion models, attention mechanisms, latent space representations, and optimization techniques. By following the methodology presented in Rombach et al. (2022), one can effectively implement a high-quality image generation pipeline.

This repository aims to provide a clear path for building your own Stable Diffusion model while offering insights into the fundamental principles of generative models and diffusion processes.
